# Clean coding example

This project aims to provide examples of how to improve python code through refactoring according to clean code principles.

## Example 1
This is an example of a piece of code that loads two datasets, performs factor analysis on one of the datasets, and then prints a report showing the relationships between the factor analysis components and the second dataset.

See [example1.py](example1.py) for an example of code in need of a refactor.  

See [example1_annotated.py](example1_annotated.py) for a version of example1.py that has been annotated with comments regarding problems in the code.

See [example1_pseudocode.py](example1_pseudocode.py) for an example of a pseudocode plan for the code.

See [example1_refactored.py](example1_refactored.py) for a refactored version of example1.py.
